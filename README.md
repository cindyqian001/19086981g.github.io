Points:
1. There are 4 boxes in total. I used a hybrid layout modelï¼Œincluding float mode(left and right) and position mode(fixed).
2. The left column is navigation bar. There are "Home","About me",and "Introduction" three labels. Here I used <a href=""> attribute. When we click on each lable, it will jump to the content corresponding to the lable.
3. In "Home" page, I put a background image and add a title "Welcome to my personal profile!"
4. In "About me" page, I put my picture and introduce my name, age and some other information on it. Here I used float mode to make the picture and the information line up.
5. About my picture, I used "border-radius=50%" and "overflow:hidden" attribute to turn my image into a circle image, which looks more comfortable.
6. I used "table,tr,td" labels to make the layout to some basic information.
7. In "Introduction" page, I introduced myself
8. I used "overflow:scroll" in the body part so that we can swipe to read the article with the mouse.
